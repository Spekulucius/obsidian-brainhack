This is Brainhack Theme: a robust theme with only one customizable option: the **accent color**.
## customize with the accent color only!
>Using the accent color, you can customize the entire look of this theme. Every color will adjust to one single change.
>
>>No more fiddling with theme settings, adjusting several sliders etc. 
>>→ only one change is enough!

>I made this theme *(mainly for myself)*, because I like to adjust the look of Obsidian on a regular basis. However, it needed adjusting more than one variable to get everything going.
>>Thats why I made Brainhack - **it is for changing to the color you are comfortable with on the fly, without distracting yourself from the workflow!**
